# TODO
1. have public & Private markets (with accounts maybe, add a backend for that?)
2. Watchlist for investors / users, 
3. 1 user should only be able to vote Yes or no, they can increase stake however so they can add more to yes later (or no)
4. put some test data in there like famous startups like Tesla or whatever
5. How about to make a design less "vibecoding" as it's very visible. Let's ask LLM to use the design blocks from this https://www.neobrutalism.dev/
6. Add more details to the startup, like categories etc. food tech, crypto, like bunch of niches
7. add filters for when it's a lot of data, also add search, also market cap, top, etc
8. what about market analysis
9. Startup sign up optional, to create market first.
10. Startup verification, milestones can be verified.
